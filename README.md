My first attempt at making a hack pad. Plus my first time using every single program. :) Followed the DIY guide to the best of my ability. 

CAD MODEL: (I got the switches of a website....wasn't sure how to make them myself)

made using fusion. nifty but annoying. 

PCB: Made in KiCad. No silkscreen bcuz i couldn't understand it for the life of me.
